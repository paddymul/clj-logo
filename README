# logo

This is an implementation of a logo like language ontop of clj-processing.

currently it is fairly dependent on clj-processing, this might change
in the future, because of the way processing works, you basically
can't do much with turtle manipulation at the repl.

This isn't meant to be a full implementation of logo, I have primarily
written this to support sail-clojure.

This has been generally influenced by netlogo
